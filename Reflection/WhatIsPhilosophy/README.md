### Critique / Reflection / What Is Philosophy
- Assume that we want to "formalize" Philosophy to the highest level of formalization, up to and before formalization breaks down our ability to undertand one another or ourselves, or differentiate the meanings between two different statements, etc.;
- Assume that we either don't care if it can even be done, is possible, or else we know it is because we've already proved it, formally or in whatever way you want it to be (thought-experiment, "informal"); SEE: NON-FORMALITY, ABSTRACTION OF POSITIONALITY, PARADOX OF ABSTRACTION;
- Assume that all we need is to achieve some level of formalism with Deleuze & Guattari's book What is philosophy?;
- Assume that this book contains the key to creating machine intelligence capable of "inventing new concepts" (as described in the chapter What is a concept? in aforementioned book);
- The rest of the thought experiment, and the experiments the experiments leads to shall follow shortly...
