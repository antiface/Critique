purity_of_heart = ["Only the Eternal is always appropriate and always present, is always true. Only the Eternal applies to each human being, whatever his age may be. The changeable exists, and when its time has passed it is changed. Therefore any statement about it is subject to change.", "Only the Eternal is constructive. The wisdom of the years is confusing. Only the wisdom of eternity is edifying.", "But as for the Eternal, the time never comes when a man has grown away from it, or has become older -- than the Eternal.", "For in relation to the Eternal, a man ages neither in the sense of time nor in the sense of an accumulation of past events.", "One dare not say of repentance and remorse that it has its time; that there is a time to be carefree and a time to be prostrated in repentance.", "There is a danger that is called delusion. It is unable to check itself. It goes on and on: then it is called perdition.", "So wonderful a power is remorse, so sincere is its friendship that to escape it entirely is the most terrible thing of all.", "The indolent youth speaks of a long life that lies before him. The indolent old man hopes that his death is still a long way off.", "When remorse awakens concern, whether it be in the youth, or in the old man, it awakens it always at the eleventh hour. It does not have much time at its disposal, for it is at the eleventh hour."]
