## Leibniz:
* If we had it [a characteristica universalis], we should be
able to reason in metaphysics and morals in much the same
way as in geometry and analysis.
* If controversies were to arise, there would be no more need
of disputation between two philosophers than between two
accountants. For it would suffice to take their pencils in
their hands, to sit down to their slates, and to say to each
other . . . : Let us calculate.
